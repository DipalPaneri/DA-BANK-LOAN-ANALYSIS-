# DA-BANK-LOAN-ANALYSIS
AN EXECUTIVE SUMMERY : 
DA Bank Loan Analysis, In order to monitor and assess our bank's lending activities and performance for the Year 2021, create a comprehensive Bank Loan Report. This report aims to provide insights into key loan-related metrics and their changes over time. The report will help The Bank Management make data-driven decisions, track our loan portfolio's health, and identify trends that can inform our lending strategies.

 Steps Involved :
* Data Manipulation : Utilizing SQL for querying, processing, and organizing loan data from databases
* Visualization : Employing tools like Tableau to create dynamic and interactive dashboards that effectively present key Performance findings.
* Key Matrics : Analyzing important metrics such as total loan applications, funded amounts, received amounts, average interest rates, and debt-to-income ratios over time.
* Trend Analysis : Evaluates an organization's financial information over a period of time, monthly trend, regional distribution, loan term, employment length, loan purpose and home ownership. 
* Loan Quality Assesment : Sorting and Differentiating between ‘Good Loans’ and ‘Bad Loans’ to assess the quality of the loan Applicant’s portfolio. 
* Detailed Reporting : Offering a detailed view of loan data, borrower profiles, and performance data for in-depth analysis. 

Here’s an overview of the key aspects involved in DA bank loan analysis:
1.  Creditworthiness Evaluation: Banks evaluate each loan application based on its merits, assessing the applicant’s financial status, credit history, and cash flow projections to determine their ability to repay the loan by DTI, Grade and Subgrade. 
2. Risk Assessment: The level of risk associated with lending to an individual or entity is carefully analyzed. High-risk applicants areless likely to be approved as they pose a greater chance of defaulting on loan payments.
3.  Financial Analysis: Various financial analysis methods, such as ratio and trend analysis, are employed. I developed comprehensive cash flow estimates measured from Installments and DTI and projections to gauge the borrower’s financial health.
 4. Collateral Review: Collateral and other sources of repayment are reviewed using the data of Home Ownership to ensure that the bank has security in case of default.
 5. Decision-Making: As a Credit analyst, I use financial reports to determine the level of risk and make informed decisions on loan approvals, considering factors like payment history, employment length, Annual Income by verification status. 
6. Loan Terms: The loan amount granted depends on the lender’s confidence that the loan will be repaid on the agree.

# PROBLEM STATEMENT :
KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS(KPIs)
1. Total Loan Applications : We need to calculate the total number of loan applications received during a specified period. Additionally, it is essential to monitor the Month-to-Date (MTD) Loan Applications and track changes Month-over-Month (MoM).
2. Total Funded Amount : Understanding the total amount of funds disbursed as loans is crucial. We also want to keep an eye on the MTD Total Funded Amount and analyse the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes in this metric.
3. Total Amount Received : Tracking the total amount received from borrowers is essential for assessing the bank's cash flow and loan repayment. We should analyse the Month-to-Date (MTD) Total Amount Received and observe the Month-over-Month (MoM) changes.
4. Average Interest Rate : Calculating the average interest rate across all loans, MTD, and monitoring the Month-over-Month (MoM) variations in interest rates will provide insights into our lending portfolio's overall cost.
5. Average Debt-to-Income Ratio (DTI) : Evaluating the average DTI for our borrowers helps us gauge their financial health. We need to compute the average DTI for all loans, MTD, and track Month-over-Month (MoM) fluctuations.
6. Good Loan v Bad Loan KPI’s : In order to evaluate the performance of our lending activities and assess the quality of our loan portfolio, we need to create a comprehensive report that distinguishes between 'Good Loans' and 'Bad Loans' based on specific loan status criteria i.e. total Loan Applications, total amount funded and total amount received/receovered by bank in terms of installments.

DETAILS Dashboard :  In our DA Bank Loan Report project, we recognize the need for a comprehensive 'Details Dashboard' that provides a consolidated view of all the essential information within our loan data. This Details Dashboard aims to offer a holistic snapshot of key loan-related metrics and data points, enabling users to access critical information efficiently. The primary objective of the Details Dashboard is to provide a comprehensive and user-friendly interface for accessing vital loan data. It will serve as a one-stop solution for users seeking detailed insights into our loan portfolio, borrower profiles, and loan performance.
